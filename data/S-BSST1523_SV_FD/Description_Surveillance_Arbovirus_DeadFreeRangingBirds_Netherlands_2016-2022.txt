Title:
Surveillance for arboviruses in free ranging dead birds in the Netherlands, 2016-2022

Content Overview:
Information on date and location of sampling, birds species and molecular testing results for Usutu virus (USUV)

Source:
One Health virology and Influenza groups,Viroscience, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands

For methods, refer to "Emergence and Dynamics of Usutu and West Nile Viruses in the Netherlands, 2016-2022" (Münger et al., 2025).

Time Frame:
2016-08-04 to 2022-12-10

Area:
European Netherlands


Fields:
"ID": Unique identifier for each tested sample, each bird is represented by a single sample
"applicant": name of insitution/system that sent samples for testing to Erasmus MC
"DeathOrSampleDate": This field ensures that each bird has a single associated date. Depending on the data source and availability, it may represent the date of death, the date the bird was found, or the date of sampling.
"DateInfo": Specifies the context of the date recorded in "DeathOrSampleDate." It can take one of three values: "DateDeath" (date of death), "DateFound" (date the bird was found), or "DateSampling" (date the bird was sampled).
"English": birdspecies name in English
"Dutch": birdspecies name in Dutch
"Latin": bird species name in Latin
"family": taxonomical classification of bird species at family level
"order": taxonomical classification of bird species at order level
"location": a general name indicating death location
"province": Province of death location
"Lat": latitude coordinate (in decimal degrees) of the death location, using the WGS84 coordinate system. 
	These coordinates were registered at the location of death and have been rounded to two decimal places to ensure data anonymization.
"Long": longitude coordinate (in decimal degrees) of the death location, using the WGS84 coordinate system. 
	These coordinates were registered at the location of death and have been rounded to two decimal places to ensure data anonymization.
"BirdUSUV": "1" indicates the bird tested positive for Usutu virus by RT-PCR and "0" that it tested negative
"BirdTestedWNV": "TRUE" indicates the bird was tested for West-Nile virus by RT-PCR, "FALSE" that it was not tested 
	(remark: unlike for Usutu virus, not all of these birds were tested fro West Nile virus, and no confirmed West Nile virus RT-PCR positives have been detected)
