"ID": unique identification code of the sampling event
"capture.date": date of capture and sampling of the bird
"Ringnumber": unique identification number assigned to each bird through the use of leg bands or rings
"English": birdspecies name in English
"Dutch": bird species name in Dutch
"Latin": bird species name in Latin
"family": taxonomical classification of bird species at family level
"order": taxonomical classification of bird species at order level
"Lat": latitude coordinate (in decimal degrees) of the sampling location, using the WGS84 coordinate system
"Long": longitude coordinate (in decimal degrees) of the sampling location, using the WGS84 coordinate system
"PMA.USUV.Ab6000":"1" indicates that the sample had a fluorescence signal =>6000 on the protein microarray and qualified for confirmation; "0" indicates the sample had a fluorescence signal <6000
"PMA.WNV.Ab6000":"1" indicates that the sample had a fluorescence signal =>6000 on the protein microarray and qualified for confirmation; "0" indicates the sample had a fluorescence signal <6000
"VNT.USUV": titer at which complete blocking of USUV infection was observed, calculated as the average of results from two serial dilutions;"NA" indicates that the sample was not tested
"VNT.WNV": titer at which complete blocking of WNV infection was observed, calculated as the average of results from two serial dilutions;"NA" indicates that the sample was not tested 
"FRNT.USUV": titer at which a ≥70% reduction in USUV infected cells counts was observed, calculated as the average of results from two serial dilutions;"NA" indicates that the sample was not tested
"FRNT.WNV": titer at which a ≥70% reduction in WNV infected cells counts was observed, calculated as the average of results from two serial dilutions;"NA" indicates that the sample was not tested 
"SeroResult": final serological result based on neautralization assays, classified as "USUV"(USUV-neutralizing antibody positive),"WNV"(WNV-neutralizing antibody positive),
"FLAVI"(Othoflavivirus-neutralizing antibody positive) or "Negative"
	"USUV" if:
	USUV PMA >= 6000 and
	(i) FRNT >= 160 and 4x titer of WNV
	(ii) USUV PMA >= 6000, no FRNT result, and VNT result >= 16 and 4x titer of WNV
	"WNV" if:
	WNV PMA >= 6000 and
	(i) FRNT >= 80 and 4x titer of USUV
	(ii) USUV PMA >= 6000, no FRNT result, but VNT >= 16 and 4x VNT titer of USUV
	"FLAVI" if:
	USUV and/or WNV PMA result >= 6000
	(i) positive FRNT, but no 4x difference between USUV and WNV
	"Negative" if: 
	FRNT negative for USUV (<160) AND WNV (<80)
